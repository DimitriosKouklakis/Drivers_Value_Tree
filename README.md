# KPI Drivers Value Tree – Executive Performance Framework

This project presents a **KPI Value Tree** designed to help executives and senior leaders understand *what truly drives business performance* and how high-level outcomes decompose into controllable operational levers.
It identifies key factors, prioritizes actions, aligns strategies, and simplifies decisions by utilizing the methodology of the 5 WHYs.

The solution is implemented in **Tableau**, with a strong emphasis on:
- Strategic alignment
- Clear KPI ownership
- Decision-oriented storytelling

## Business Problem

Organizations often track dozens of KPIs without clarity on:
- How they relate to each other
- Which metrics actually drive top-line or bottom-line results
- Where leadership should intervene when performance deviates

This KPI Value Tree addresses this by:
- Structuring KPIs hierarchically
- Linking strategic outcomes to operational drivers
- Enabling fast root-cause analysis at an executive level

## Tableau Implementation

The dashboard is built in Tableau and includes:
- Interactive value tree navigation
- KPI performance vs target indicators
- Drilldowns by product, country, and time
- Consistent KPI definitions across all views

The design prioritizes **clarity over decoration**, ensuring that insights are accessible within seconds.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Top-down logic:** Executives start with outcomes, not metrics
- **Single source of truth:** Each KPI has one definition and owner
- **Limited cognitive load:** Maximum of 5–7 KPIs visible at each level
- **Actionability:** Every KPI answers the question “What can I do if this changes?”

## Stakeholders & Usage

This framework is designed for:
- C-level executives
- Heads of Product, Marketing, and Finance
- BI teams aligning reporting across departments

Typical use cases:
- Monthly business reviews
- Performance deep dives
- Strategic planning & prioritization

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Strategic KPI thinking beyond raw reporting
- Ability to translate business goals into measurable drivers
- Strong dashboard design and storytelling principles
- Executive-level BI ownership

This project reflects how I approach BI not as reporting, but as a **decision-support system**.
