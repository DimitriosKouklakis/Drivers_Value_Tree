# KPI Drivers Value Tree – Executive Performance Framework

This project presents a **KPI Value Tree** designed to help executives and senior leaders understand *what truly drives business performance* and how high-level outcomes decompose into controllable operational levers.
It identifies key factors, prioritizes actions, aligns strategies, and simplifies decisions.

The solution is implemented in **Tableau**, with a strong emphasis on:
- Strategic alignment
- Clear KPI ownership
- Decision-oriented storytelling

## Business Problem

Organizations often track dozens of KPIs without clarity on:
- How they relate to each other
- Which metrics actually drive top-line or bottom-line results
- Where leadership should intervene when performance deviates

This KPI Value Tree addresses this by:
- Structuring KPIs hierarchically
- Linking strategic outcomes to operational drivers
- Enabling fast root-cause analysis at an executive level

--

## Tableau Implementation

The dashboard is built in Tableau and includes:
- Interactive value tree navigation
- KPI performance vs target indicators
- Drilldowns by product, country, and time
- Consistent KPI definitions across all views

The design prioritizes **clarity over decoration**, ensuring that insights are accessible within seconds.
